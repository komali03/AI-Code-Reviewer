# GenAI App - AI Code Reviewer

This is a Streamlit web application that uses Google Generative AI (Gemini-Pro) to review Python code, identify issues, and suggest improvements.

## Features
- Accepts Python code input via a text area.  
- Provides detailed code reviews with suggestions and corrected snippets.  
- Displays warnings and error handling with retries for API requests.  

## Prerequisites
- Python installed on your system.  
- A valid Google Generative AI API Key.  

## Installation

1. **Clone the repository:**  
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/komali03/AI-Code-Reviewer.git
   cd AI-Code-Reviewer
   ```

2. **Install dependencies:**  
   Ensure you have `pip` installed, then run:  
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

3. **Set up .env file and .gitignore file**  
   Create a `.env` file in the same working directory and store the API key.

   API_KEY = "your-api-key-here"
   ```
   add .env in .gitignore file.

## Usage

1. **Run the application:**  
   ```bash
   streamlit run app.py
   ```

2. **Enter your Python code** in the provided text area.  
3. **Click "Validate Code"** to receive feedback on bugs and suggestions.  

## Requirements

The following packages are necessary to run the app:  
- `streamlit`  
- `google-generativeai`  

*(Dependencies are listed in `requirements.txt`)*  

## File Structure
```
ðŸ“‚ project-folder/
   â”œâ”€â”€ app.py               # Main Streamlit application
   â”œâ”€â”€ requirements.txt     # Python dependencies
   â””â”€â”€ .env                # Google API Key (add in .env)
   â””â”€â”€ .gitignore           # stores files to be hidden (.env)

```

## Notes
- The app uses exponential backoff to handle API errors gracefully.  
- API Key should be kept secure and not shared publicly.
